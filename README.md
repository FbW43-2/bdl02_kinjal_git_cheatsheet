#  Git commands cheat-sheet: the most useful git commands

## 1. Navigate to your git project folder

Use `cd`to move between folders. E.g:

```
cd workspace
cd bdl02_dodhiakinjal_git_cheatsheet
```

## 2. Check the status of the project

I can use these commands anytime to inspect my project

- `git status`

    With `git status` I can see if some changes have happened and if some files are ready to be committed.
    It gives me an overview of the project at that specific moment in time.
- `git log`
- `git diff`
